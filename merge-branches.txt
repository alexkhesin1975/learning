git merge "name" (merges naed branch in to current brunch)

there is few types of merge

fast-forward:
in case in master branch was no change since second branch created

master: m1,m2
feature:f1,f2

git merge feature

master: m1,m2,f1,f2
feature:f1,f2

fast-forward:
git merge --squash feature ( will take all commits from feature and add them to master as 1 commit[the git commit -m requred])

in that case the HEAD will be same for both branches
