"now we know how branches works" 

git checkout "name"  == git switch "name" (switches between branches or creates new one if such name not exists)
git branch ( list branches)
git checkout -b "name" == git switch -c "name" (create branches and swith in to it)
git merge "name" ( merges the named branc in to currently located in)
git branch -D "name" ( deletes branch) [can be deleted multiple branches with space between them]
